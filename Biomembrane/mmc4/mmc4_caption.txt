Figure. Molecular Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum Likelihood method 
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the General Time Reversible model [1]. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-11200.2162) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained by applying the BioNJ method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL) approach. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 1.0887)). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 1.2678% sites). The analysis involved 15 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. There were a total of 1194 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [2].
