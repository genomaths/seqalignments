Figure. Inferred Ancestral Sequences of taxa 
Ancestral states were inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method [1] under the General Time Reversible model [1]. The tree shows a set of possible nucleotides (states) at each ancesteral node based on their inferred likelihood at site 1. The set of states at each node is ordered from most likely to least likely, excluding states with probabilities below 5%. The initial tree was inferred using a pre-computed tree file. The rates among sites were treated as a Gamma distribution using 5 Gamma Catagories (Gamma Distribution option). The analysis involved 25 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. There were a total of 927 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [2].
