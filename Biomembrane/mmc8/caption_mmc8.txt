Figure. Inferred Ancestral Sequences of taxa 
Ancestral states were inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method [1] under the General Time Reversible model [1]. The tree shows a set of possible nucleotides (states) at each ancesteral node based on their inferred likelihood at site 1. For each node only the most probable state is shown. The initial tree was inferred using a pre-computed tree file. The rates among sites were treated as a Gamma distribution using 5 Gamma Catagories (Gamma Distribution option). The analysis involved 30 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st+2nd+3rd+Noncoding. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. That is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position. There were a total of 2019 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6 [2].
