# Welcome to *seqalignments* repository 

This respository contains several sequence alignments of protein-encoding 
DNA from several species. The following alignments are included, so far:
  
   1. Cancer genetic-susceptibility genes from 9 mammals.
   2. Biomembrane proteins: 9 genes from several species
   3. Populus tremula: 19 proteins
   
## Data format    
The sequence alignments of protein-encoding DNA are given fasta format (*.fasta and *.fas).
 
   
## 1. Cancer genetic-susceptibility genes from 9 mammals.
   The consequetive multiple sequence alignment is provided for four cancer
   related genes ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and P53. The sequences are from nine
   mammals: Human, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Rhesus_monkey, Dog, Horse, Cow, Mouse,
   common rat, and a marsupial: Opossum.
   
   In the sequence alignment, genes are consecutivally allocated in the following order: 

   | Gene  | start | end  |
   |-------|-------|------|
   | ATM   | 1     | 3074 |
   | BRCA1 | 3075  | 4983 |
   | BRCA2 | 4984  | 8549 |
   | p53   | 8550  | 8946 |
   
## 2. Biomembrane proteins: 9 genes from several species
Sequence alignment alignments for the following biomembranes genes (from several species) are provided:

mmc2: ADP/ATP translocase 1
mmc4: intramembrane serine protease GlpG
mmc6: potassium channel protein
mmc8: ferrichrome outer membrane transporter
mmc10: formate dehydrogenase, nitrate-inducible, iron-sulfur subunit
mmc12: formate dehydrogenase-N subunit gamma
mmc14: sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1 isoform a
mmc16: sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit beta-1
mmc18: beta-2 adrenergic receptor

The alignment with the prediction of the ancestor states are provided as well. The ancestor states were estimated with
the sofware MEGA6 (Tamura K., Stecher G., Peterson D., Filipski A., and Kumar S. (2013). MEGA6: Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis version 6.0. Molecular Biology and Evolution30: 2725-2729). The guide tree and the description of the algorithm used is also given.

## 3. Populus tremula: 19 proteins
    The dataset of DNA protein-encoding genes was derived in the study:
	Ingvarsson PK. Natural selection on synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations shapes patterns of polymorphism in Populus tremula. Mol Biol Evol, 2010, 27:650–60.
	
	The autors deposited the datasetat GenBank/EMBL databases (accession numbers EU752500–EU754117).
